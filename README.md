🚀 Internship Final Project
Welcome to the Internship Final Project! 🎉

✨ What's Inside?

    This project integrates multiple features into a single application, but what makes it truly unique is the Gemini-powered chatbot. Yes, you heard it right! Google's Large Language Model, Gemini, has been fine-tuned with custom instructions (a little bit of prompt engineering wizardry 🪄), turning it into your all-in-one assistant capable of performing tasks that go beyond the usual chatbot capabilities. Move over, ChatGPT! 😎

🚀 Getting Started
        
    Ready to dive in? Here's how you can set things up:

1. Install MongoDB

    First, ensure you have MongoDB installed on your computer. Alternatively, update the code to use MongoDB services like Azure CosmosDB by modifying the MongoClient in chat_template.py.

2. Install Python & Libraries

    Make sure Python is installed, then install all necessary libraries by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Up the API Key

    Before you get started, don’t forget to put your GEMINI API KEY in chat_template.py. This file acts as a blueprint for all your new sessions, so having the API key in place is crucial for the chatbot to function correctly.

4. Launch the App

    Get started by running:

    streamlit run Home.py
            or
    python -m streamlit run Home.py

5. Start the Automation Service

    Open another command prompt, navigate to the automation folder, and run:

    python automation_service.py
    Make sure both commands are running in separate terminals!

🎉 You’re Ready to Roll!
   
    Your application is now up and running. Note that SMS and WhatsApp features require phone numbers—names won’t do the trick here. For emails, you'll need to provide the recipient's email address. A demo sender email is included, but feel free to swap it out.

🤖 Gemini Chatbot Setup

    To use the chatbot, you'll need a GEMINI API KEY. You can grab one for free at AI Studio. Once you've got your key, you're all set!

    Your chat history is stored in MongoDB, so your assistant will always remember where you left off. No more forgetting those important tasks! 🧠

    Enjoy your all-in-one assistant, and have fun exploring all the features! 🚀
